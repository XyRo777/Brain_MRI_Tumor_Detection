# Brain_MRI_Tumor_Detection
Developed a CNN-based model for detecting brain tumors using MRI images. The project involved dataset management with PyTorch, visualizing data, training a custom CNN, and handling overfitting. Applied machine learning techniques to automate tumor detection with a focus on real-time medical imaging.
